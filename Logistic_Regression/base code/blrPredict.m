function [label] = blrPredict(W, X)
% blrObjFunction predicts the label of data given the data and parameter W
% of Logistic Regression
%
% Input:
% W: the matrix of weight of size (D + 1) x 10. Each column is the weight
%    vector of a Logistic Regression classifier.
% X: the data matrix of size N x D
%
% Output: 
% label: vector of size N x 1 representing the predicted label of
%        corresponding feature vector given in data matrix
